2) OpenCV: OpenCV is the main library used for computer vision tasks. You can
install OpenCV using pip, which is Python's package manager. Open Command
Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command:
3) pip install opencv-python-headless
4) Additional Libraries: There are no additional libraries required for the provided
code snippet. However, ensure that you have the necessary files such as
'coco.names', 'ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt', and
'frozen_inference_graph.pb' in the same directory as your Python script.

To install opencv-python package:
• pip install opencv-python


Steps to execute the project:
1. There are two way to access the project files
• Firstly choose any directory u wish to store the project files ,right
click on the screen and select open terminal. Make sure u have git

option “download zip file”
• Extract the zip file at the desired directory .
• Then open pycharm go to “Files” then to” Open” and select the
directory where u have stored the project folder and then click on the
project folder
• All the project files will be imported.
2.Install the libraries as mentioned earlier in requirements
3.execute the code by clicking on run symbol which is situated at the right top
